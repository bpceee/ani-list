This is a simple Next.js application that uses GraphQL to fetch data from a server. It is built with TypeScript and uses the Apollo Client for data fetching.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Graphql codegen

To generate the types for the GraphQL queries, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run gql:codegen
```
